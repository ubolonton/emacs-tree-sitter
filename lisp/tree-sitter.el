;;; Commentary:

;; This is the base framework of the Emacs binding for Tree-sitter, an
;; incremental parsing system. It includes a minor mode that provides a
;; buffer-local syntax tree that is updated on every text change. This minor
;; mode is the base for other libraries to build on. An example is the included
;; code-highlighting minor mode.

requested by end user, or other dependent modes.

When `tree-sitter-mode' is disabled, it automatically disables MODE, which will
not function correctly otherwise. This happens before `tree-sitter-mode' cleans
up its own state.

SETUP-FUNCTION is called when MODE is enabled, after MODE variable has been set
to t, and after `tree-sitter-mode' has already been enabled. However, it must
not assume that `tree-sitter-tree' is non-nil, since the first parse may not
happen yet. It should instead set up hooks to handle parse events.

TEARDOWN-FUNCTION is called when MODE is disabled, after MODE variable has been
set to nil. It should clean up any state set up by MODE, and should not signal
any error. It is also called when SETUP-FUNCTION signals an error, to undo any
partial setup.
